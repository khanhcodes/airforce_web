          <p>
            The Air Force Research Laboratory leads the discovery, development
            and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for our air,
            space and cyberspace forces.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            While our heritage dates back to 1918, AFRL officially launched in
            1997 to consolidate the four former Air Force laboratories and the
            Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The laboratory and its
            predecessors have overseen more than 100 years of critical research
            efforts for the Department of the Air Force and Department of
            Defense. With technology breakthroughs found in all of today's
            modern aircraft and weapons systems, including the F-117 Nighthawk,
            B-2 Spirit, C-17 Globemaster and the F-22 Raptor, AFRL has
            contributed to significant advancements in modern communications,
            electronics, manufacturing, medical research and products.

          <h1>Personnel and Resources</h1>
          <p>
            AFRL employs approximately 11,500 military, civilian and contractor
            personnel, and manages a $7 billion portfolio of investments. The
            lab supports external customers and partners with industry while
            investing in basic research, applied research and advanced
            technology development. As one integrated lab, AFRL seamlessly
            supports the Science & Technology needs of two services: the Air
            Force and the Space Force.
